### Style 27: Lazy Rivers in Haskell and JavaScript
I was not sure if it will be OK to implement this exercise in Haskell, since dataflow and lazy evaluaation is naturl in Haskell.
I however extracted memory usage profiling chart from my Haskell progrm that shows memory is indeed growing linearly as more words is 
generated by functions.
