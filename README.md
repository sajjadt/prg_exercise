As part of a graduate class at UC Irvine, I have implemented term frequency program in some of the styles covered in Crista Lopes' [book](https://www.amazon.com/Exercises-Programming-Style-Cristina-Videira/dp/1482227371) in other languages than Python (Since she has already implemnted [all of them](https://github.com/crista/exercises-in-programming-style) in Python). This book is great and I recommend to anyone who wants to learn about philosophy and historical evolution of programming languages and design methodologies.
